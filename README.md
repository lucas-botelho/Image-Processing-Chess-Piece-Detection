# **Image Processing Chess Piece Detection**

A group project aimed at experimenting with **image processing** techniques. The primary goal of the project was to develop an algorithm capable of detecting **chess pieces** in images. The project explores various image manipulation algorithms and applies them to real-world images.

## **Features**
- Detects chess pieces in images by analyzing the chessboard.
- Select a chessboard square, and the algorithm identifies which chess piece is there.

## **Purpose**
- Gain hands-on experience in **image processing**.
- Build an algorithm to detect chess pieces by processing images of chessboards.
- Experiment with different image processing techniques and compare their effectiveness.
- Collaborate as a group to explore various methods and share results.

## **Project Goals**
- Explore and experiment with different image processing techniques.
- Develop an algorithm to detect chess pieces based on image analysis.
- Gain practical experience in computer vision and image manipulation tasks.
