# **CG_OpenCV_2024**

A group project aimed at experimenting with **image processing** techniques and comparing the results using the **OpenCV** library. The project explores various image manipulation algorithms and applies them to real-world images to evaluate OpenCV's capabilities and performance.

## **Features**
- Implements a range of image processing techniques such as:
  - Image filtering (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection).
  - Image transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, translation).
  - Color space transformations (e.g., RGB to grayscale).
- Compares results of custom image processing algorithms with OpenCV's built-in functions.
- Provides a visual interface to view and interact with processed images.

## **Purpose**
- Gain hands-on experience in **image processing** and **computer vision**.
- Understand the core functionalities of the **OpenCV** library and its performance.
- Experiment with different image processing techniques and compare their effectiveness.
- Collaborate as a group to explore various methods and share results.

## **Project Goals**
Explore and experiment with different image processing techniques.
Evaluate the performance and results of OpenCVâ€™s built-in functions compared to custom algorithms.
Gain practical experience in computer vision and image manipulation tasks.
